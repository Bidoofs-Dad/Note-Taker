# Note Taker

## About The Application

This application will help you keep notes of anything that you may want to remember! Be it a grocery list, notes about what you want to get done around the house, or just simply to remind yourself where you left your car keys (I'm guilty of needing that sometimes)

This application allows you to write out a note and save it, after refreshing the page, it will appear on the left hand side! From there you can always add more notes, or click on an existing one to have it show up (so you can remember where those keys are ðŸ˜‰)

It also has the functionality to delete any saved notes! If you click the delete button next to a note once, it will be deleted after refreshing the page! Otherwise if you double click it, it will delete right before your eyes! It utilizes the ID given to each note to do this. The IDs are generated from using the uuid npm package!

## Issues

I had a couple issues along the way, some solved, some are still present;

* One issue I had is the fact that after saving a note, it doesn't appear until you refresh the page, for some reason I just couldn't get it to work. However the functionality is still there at least!

* Another issue was making it so the notes deleted before your eyes after one click instead of needing a double click. It isn't that much of an issue, but worthy enough to throw in here!

* I ran into multiple issues trying to get the POST method to work, as that is a part that I'm still trying to understand completely, but in the end, I was able to make it work!

## Screenshots

Below I will include some screenshots of the application working!

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this project wasn't overly difficult. I feel it would have gone much smoother though if I better grasped how to run these servers better. But that just means room for improvement! Mainly it was just getting the POST method to work was the main hurdle, other than that, not too bad! I look forward to learning more about deploying servers!
